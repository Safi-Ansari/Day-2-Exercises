1. you just have "retrieving" message, but I guess, a.get(index) call is missing to actually retrieving the value. Setting value looks good.

2. looks good.

3. ReverseOrder class is blank.

4. Looks good. One small improvement, no need to implement but remember. You are calling charAt() multiple times, you can call it once and keep the value in local variable. that variable can be used everywhere.

5. looks good.

6. I realized that question is incomplete and not clear. But implementation is fine.

7. Two things:

		a. you have created Book class, but not used as key in hashmap.
		
		b. when you will use it, you need to implement the hashcode and equals contracts.
